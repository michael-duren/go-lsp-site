<Card title="Hello" icon="seti:powershell">
  I'm Michael.

I'm a self taught software engineer based in St. Paul MN  specializing in C# .NET, SQL, Typescript, HTML and CSS.
Avid debugger and problem-solver with excellent communication skills and a knack for collaboration.
I make electronic music in my free time. Love old synthesizers and modern jazz. Neovim enthusiast.

Currently I'm learning Go Lang and C, though I've taken a bit of a break on C to focus on Go.
I find lower level programming fascinating, and understanding how pieces of software interact with hardware is a passion of mine.
Tech that seems mysterious or complex is what I'm drawn to.

Besides programming, I'm a huge fan of lifting weights, fitness, and being in the outdoors.
