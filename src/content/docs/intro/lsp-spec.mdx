<Card title="High Level Overview" icon="rocket">
  For web developers who write restful APIs, or work with JSON in general this specification will seem very familiar.
  The LSP is a JSON-RPC based protocol that allows developers to write language servers that can communicate with a wide variety of editors and IDEs (the client).
  It follows the simple request/response pattern that is common in web development.
</Card>

## Request/Response Pattern

  Each request and response has two parts a header and content which are seperated by a `\r\n`.
  The header simply describes the content length and the content type, content-type defaulting to `application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8`, so for our purposes only `Content-Length` is required.
  The request content is a JSON object that contains four main fields: 

  1. `jsonrpc` - the version of the protocol (we'll be using 2.0)

  2. `method`  - the method that is being called by the client for example this `'textDocument/definition'` to go to a object or functions definiton in your IDE/editor.

  3. `params` - the parameters that are passed with that method, each method has it's own set of parameters that are necessary for each call to work.

  4. `id` - the id of the request, this is used to match the response to the request.

:::note

**Example (taken from the LSP docs):**
  ```json
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "textDocument/completion",
	"params": {
		...
	}
}
```
:::

For a response the content is very similar but with a few key differences: rather than a method and parameters, a result or error field is returned.
The response of course includes the id of the request.

**There are a couple of other message types.**

<ul>
  <li class="list-disc">
  Notification messages which are similar to requests but do not require a response, they work like events.
  </li>
  <li class="list-disc">
  Notificaton and requests whose methods start with '$/' are messages which might not be supported by all clients or servers.
  </li>
  <li class="list-disc">
    Finally there are cancellation and progress support, which www will not be covering in this guide.
  </li>
</ul>

## Server Capabilities

Capabilites communicate between the client and server what features are supported.
Both client and server capabilities are sent as part of the `initialize` request, we won't be too worried about the client 
capabilities in this guide but the server capabilities are important.

## Lifecycle Messages

The client in the LSP spec is doing more than just requesting information, it is also responsible for starting and stopping the server.
There are a couple of lifecycle messages that are used for this purpose.

<ul>
  <li class="list-disc">
        **Initialize && Initialized** - This message is sent from the client which includes the clients capabilities previously mentioned.
        The client will not send any other messages until it receives a response from the server, this is the initial handshake.
  </li>
  <li class="list-disc">
    **Register & Unregister** - These messages are used to register and unregister capabilities with the server.
  </li>
  <li class="list-disc">
        **Shutdown & Exit** - These messages are used to stop the server.
  </li>
</ul>
