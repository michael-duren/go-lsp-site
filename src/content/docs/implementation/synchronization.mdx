title: Synchronization
description: Text Documents Synchronization
---

We're moving ahead here, we have round trips working between our client and server, we've communicated
capabilities acknowledged each others strengths and weaknesses and are now in a healthy relationship... 
At least our server and client are.

Next up, we're going to start talking about synchronization.
How is it that when you change a document a letter on a variable for example, you all of a sudden get a red squiggly line under it?
Well the answer is somewhat obvious, our editors are constantly communicating based on events that often we are triggering.
To start receiving messages based on these events is actually quite simple.
When we created `initialize.go` file, we created a empty type called `ServerCapabilities` to add capabilities to at a later point.
Well now is time to do that so, the first capability we want to inform the client of is `textDocumentSync`.
So in our `initialize.go` file, we're going to add the following:
```go
type ServerCapabilities struct {
	TextDocumentSync int `json:"textDocumentSync"`
}
```
For the value of `textDocumentSync` lets check the [documentation:](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_synchronization)
We see that we need to tell the client what type of `textDocumentSync` we support and for 
our purposes we're going to support `Full` changes,
since we won't be getting into advanced diffing and patching of documents this evening.

So lets update our helper function to set the appropriate value.
```go ins={9}
func NewInitializeResponse(id int) InitializeResponse {
	return InitializeResponse{
		Response: Response{
			Id:      &id,
			Jsonrpc: "2.0",
		},
		Result: InitializeResult{
			Capabilities: ServerCapabilities{
				TextDocumentSync: 1,
			}, // what we're able to do
			ServerInfo: ServerInfo{
				Name:    "demo_lsp", // name of lsp
				Version: "0.0.0.0",  // version of lsp
			},
		},
	}
}
```

After rebuilding and restarting our server, we can now see that not only is the client aware of the `textDocumentSync` capability,
it has sends us a new message every time an event like save, change, or open happens.

So although this is very exciting, we're not actually doing anything with these messages, that is outside of the scope of this talk.
However we are going to implement a hover feature next that will help us write every developers favorite thing documentation!
