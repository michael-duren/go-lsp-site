Next up is implementing the `textDocument/Hover` method.
This method is called when the user hovers over a symbol in the editor, or for neovim users a user might press `K` in normal mode.
The server should respond with a hover object that contains the hover information.

Lets checkout Microsofts **[documentation on the hover method](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_hover).**
Skip the client capabilities and the response part for now.
We see that the request `HoverParams` extends two other types `TextDocumentPositionParams` and `WorkDoneProgressParams`.
So we know we need to create these interfaces in order to decode the request body and actually do something with it.

Let's start there, one great thing about these docs is that you can simply 
click on the types and go to their definition just like an editor.

We'll create two new files and add the following (converted from the typescript docs to go lang)
```bash
touch lsp/hover.go
```

```go title="lsp/hover.go"
package lsp

type HoverRequest struct {
	Request
	Params HoverParams `json:"params"`
}

type HoverParams struct {
	TextDocumentPositionParams
}

type HoverResponse struct {
	Response
	Result HoverResult `json:"result"`
}

type HoverResult struct {
	Contents string `json:"contents"`
}
```

Now to tell our client that we support the hover method we need to add it to the `ServerCapabilities` struct.
```go title="lsp/server.go" ins={3, 18}
type ServerCapabilities struct {
	TextDocumentSync int  `json:"textDocumentSync"`
	HoverProvider    bool `json:"hoverProvider"`
}


// ... other code...

func NewInitializeResponse(id int) InitializeResponse {
	return InitializeResponse{
		Response: Response{
			Id:      &id,
			Jsonrpc: "2.0",
		},
		Result: InitializeResult{
			Capabilities: ServerCapabilities{
				TextDocumentSync: 1,
				HoverProvider:    true,
			}, // what we're able to do
			ServerInfo: ServerInfo{
				Name:    "demo_lsp", // name of lsp
				Version: "0.0.0.0",  // version of lsp
			},
		},
	}
}
```
