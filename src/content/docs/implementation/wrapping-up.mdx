title: Wrapping Up
description: Thanks for reading

We have barely scratched the surface of the language server protocol, but I hope this was an exciting introduction
into what is possible.

With really just a few lines of go, we have setup a simple hover implementation, created a way to manage document state,
encoding/decoding of messages, and understood the basic structure of the language server protocol.

## Next Steps

Next steps for me are looking into DAP (debug adapter protocol) and how to implement that in go lang.
I love using neovim as my editor but am limited by the current state of support for C#, I hope to write tooling using `go lang`
so that I can switch from Jet Brains Rider to neovim at work.

## Thanks

Thanks to Jesse and the rest of GoMN for the opportunity to speak tonight.
I hope you all enjoyed the presentation.
