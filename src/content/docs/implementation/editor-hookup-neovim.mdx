title: Hooking up our LSP to Neovim 
description: Hooking up our LSP to the editor
---

Its time to talk to hook up our editor!
For this rather than use something like lsp-config, I'm going to create an auto command that will hook up our LSP server to our editor
once a markdown file is opened.

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  pattern = "markdown",
  callback = function()
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = "markdown-awesome-server",
      cmd = { "/Users/michaelduren/Code/learning/go-meetups/demo-proj/demo_lsp" },
    })
  end,
})
```

We can give it any name we like, we just need to assign the absolute path of where our binary is located, and we can start the server.
Typically we would have a `/bin/` folder nested perhaps somewhere in our home directory where we would store our binaries, but for development it's nice to have it in the project directory.


## Startup

**Next, simply exit vim.**

Create a markdown file (I have neovim aliased to vim)

```bash
touch test.md && vim test.md
```

You can add some contents if you would like, but that's it lets go check our logs in our project!

About four lines in after "initialize" we should see a huge json blob.
In here we have a lot of information about the capabilities of our server, and the client.
Towards the bottom we have information about our client specifically we should see our old friend neovim!

```json
    "clientInfo": {
      "version": "0.10.0-dev",
      "name": "Neovim"
    },
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have successfully hooked up your LSP server to your editor!
Moving forward everytime we open a markdown file with our editor, our LSP server will start up and we can start sending requests to it!
