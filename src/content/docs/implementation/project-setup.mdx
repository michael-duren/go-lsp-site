<Aside type="danger" title="Heads up!">
    I have only been programming with go lang for a couple months now.
    I focus primarily on C#, SQL, and TS at work, so if there are any mistakes, industry standards, best practices, etc. with go lang that I miss please let me know so I can improve.
</Aside>

## Now for the fun part!

One of the great things about go lang, is that setting up a project can be literally as easy as the commands below:
```bash
mkdir demo_lsp && cd demo_lsp
go mod init demo_lsp && touch main.go
```
We don't need a crazy amount of files to get started, just a `main.go` file and a `go.mod` file.

<FileTree>

- go.mod
- main.go

</FileTree>

For starter we'll add a simple logger to our `main.go` file so that we can see the requests and responses that are executed.

<Code lang="go" code={mainCodeSetup} title={"main.go"} />

We can go ahead and run our project using the command below:
```bash
go run main.go
```

We should see a directory called `logs` created in the root of our project with a log file inside it.


<FileTree>

- go.mod
- main.go
- logs
    - log_2024-06-01.log

</FileTree>

## Encoding and Decoding Messages

Now we have a simple logger setup, we can start to work on encoding and decoding messages.
We know from the LSP overview and documentation that a message just has two parts a header and a body, that may look someting like this:

```json
Content-Length: 67
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
        "processId": 1234,
        "rootPath": "/some/path"
    }
}
```

So lets go ahead and create a package to handle this.

```bash
mkdir rpc  && touch rpc/rpc.go
```
