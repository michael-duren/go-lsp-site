description: Using the hover event to return synonyms of words in markdown files.

Lastly we're going to user our hover event to return synonyms of words in markdown files. 
Usually when I'm writing anything I have a poor habit of using the same words and end up going from text editor to google often.
Looking up the synonyms is meant to represent what we would do if we were actually looking up definitions and syntax from the compiler/codebase.
