# What is a LSP?

## Definition from Microsofts the offical LSP website

> What is the Language Server Protocol?
> Adding features like auto complete, go to definition, or documentation on hover for a programming language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each development tool, as each tool provides different APIs for implementing the same feature.
>
> A Language Server is meant to provide the language-specific smarts and communicate with development tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication.
>
> The idea behind the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is to standardize the protocol for how such servers and development tools communicate. This way, a single Language Server can be re-used in multiple development tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort.
>
> LSP is a win for both language providers and tooling vendors!
